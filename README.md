This repo contains the full solution and source code to the Fluent XAML Theme Editor - a tool that helps demonstrate the flexibility of the [Fluent Design System](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/) as well as supports the app development process by generating XAML markup for our ResourceDictionary framework used in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications.

The source code located in this repo was created with the Universal Windows Platform available in Visual Studio and is designed to run on desktop, mobile and future devices that support the Universal Windows Platform.

> **Note:** If you are unfamiliar with XAML, the Universal Windows Platform, Fluent Design or resources and ResourceDictionaries, it is highly recommended that you visit the [Design Universal Windows Platform](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/design) site and familiarize yourself with the language and framework that this tool is intended for.
